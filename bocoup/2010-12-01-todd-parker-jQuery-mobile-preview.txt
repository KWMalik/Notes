** The challenge

1.82 billion web-enabled mobiles by 2013 (projected)
not just phones, but tablets, other intermediate devices

device/browser diversity

Opera, iPhone, Nokia, Blackberry, Android, iPod Touch, netFront, samsung, ucweb, other
23%, 16%, 15%, 15%, 7.5%, 7%, 3%, 1%, 1%, 3%

"our job as developers, is to make things work as well as they can across multiple browsers; but trying to being a developer in the mobile space is a big challenge."

* different contexts, same expectations

try to serve up a really good experience across all formats that you can.
render things the same way as you can.

** goals & approach

one codebase, all platforms

the goals of jquery mobile is to build something that works in absolutely as many places as possible.
so jquery mobile is targeting iOS, android, blackberry, bada, windows phone, palm webos, symbian, meego, fennec.

usable on older devices - trying to work with devices that may/may not have javascript support. 

unified user interface

instead of designing as iOS app/experience, try to make something that works on all platform.

lessons learned- strive for powerful extensible theming (themeroller)

even though we're targetting a lot of devices, we're trying to make this as clean as possible with html5/css3 support via progressive enhancement

emphasis on semantic html:

<label for="foo">Slider:</label>
<input type="range" name="foo" id="foo" value="0" min="0" max="100" />

instead of having to declare css and workarounds, jquery mobile aims to allow you to declare html5 and perform adaptations for you.

* markup-driven configuration

you can just write html and not have to fiddle with javascript or css to get a mobile-friendly view.

<ul data-role="listview"> ... </ul>

it will pickup thumbnails, detect semantic markup, etc. to create an experience

* feature-test-driven (no sniffing)

avoidance of browser sniffing to try and narrow-target or exclude phones.
