--- jQTouch: Building Mobile Apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by Jonathan Stark

Opening Statement

The proliferation of mobile devices that are web enabled is one of the greatest potential benefits that has been available to mankind.

-- Huge & Growing

* 5 billion cell phone subscriptions
* Smart phone share at 15%
* 56% of public Wi-Fi connections were from mobile devices

In 2009, more than half of WiFi connections were from mobile devices. Not just phones, but gaming devices such as PSPs, Sidekicks, etc.

-- Types of Mobile Apps

* Native Apps
* Web Apps
* SMS Apps

-- Drawbacks

* Native Apps - Fragmentation
  Have to make BB versions, iPhone versions, etc.
* Web Apps - Sandboxing
* SMS Apps - Discoverability
  Tough to reach new people. Quite like a command-line interface.
  
The approach that is best for you depends on your goals and target market.

-- Native vs. Web Apps

* Considerations

Native Strengths: Cosmetics, Functionality
  Ex. If this is an app for a snowboard company, needs immersion, cinematics; this needs to be a native app.
  Ex. Has to have access to camera, mic, GPS, etc.
  
  Often, firms don't have native app developers in house.
  
Web Strengths: Testing, Distribution, Support
  Testing is straightforward and easier on the web.
  Ex. iPhone apps are limited to 100 testers.
  
Varies: Development, Payment

Q: In regards to native apps, are you biased towards iPhone? As opposed to Android? Are these limitations strictly based against iPhones?
A: Generally, if someone builds a native app, it is almost certain that they're going to target an iPhone; as it is the most restrictive yet has the most customers. In general, people demand iPhone apps too.

-- Personal Opinion: Web Apps Win

* Cheapest to produce
* Most standardized
* Easiest to distribute

Opinion: 75% of apps in the iPhone app store could have been done just as easily as a web app.
