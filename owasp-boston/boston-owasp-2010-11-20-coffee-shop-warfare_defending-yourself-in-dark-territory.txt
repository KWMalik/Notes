Q: Why are companies allowed to have data walk off-site in the first place?
A: They probably shouldn't. In my case, should I have live data for testing? Likely not. But in the case of the TSA breach, it was someone who walked in and walked out with a thumbdrive. No public loss.

** Connecting to Wi-Fi hotspots
* always ask what network you should use.

Q: Does it matter if you are using a public network if you are using HTTPS?

Q: What about VPN clients?
A: VPN clients are safer.

Q: I'm curious how an evil network owner would circumvent HTTPS protection?
A: Certificate substitution, though you would see errors.
