 - easy to sell

Q: Why are companies allowed to have data walk off-site in the first place?
A: They probably shouldn't. In my case, should I have live data for testing? Likely not. But in the case of the TSA breach, it was someone who walked in and walked out with a thumbdrive. No public loss.

* hard drive encryption use has gone up
* a lot of times, we can't solve the problem, but we can help improve it.

Q: Today, the data you're handling, would have to be encrypted under Massachusetts law, correct?
A: Correct.

* The consequences of losing personal data are going up.
* It is tougher to attack organizations, but less effort to target users in public areas.

** protection from theft
* frequently stolen from cars
* frequently stolen from libraries
* use in-room safe.
* 50% chance of hotel mag-stripe keys matching wrong rooms.
* mag-stripe hacking is simple.

Survey: How many people lock their consoles when walking away from a workstation.
Response: About 2/3rds of the room

* If there is a data-breach from your machine; who gets blamed for it? You.

** Connecting to Wi-Fi hotspots
* always ask what network you should use.

Q: Does it matter if you are using a public network if you are using HTTPS?
A: Yes. SSL is only point-to-point security, not end-to-end. Man-in-the-Middle attacks are possible over public wifi.

Q: What about VPN clients?
A: VPN clients are safer.

Q: I'm curious how an evil network owner would circumvent HTTPS protection?
A: Certificate substitution, though you would see errors.

** Mitigating Settings
* Personal Firewalls
* Turn off sharing (file/printer/drive/etc)
* Use VPN for private connections
* Turn off Wifi when not in use.
* Bluetooth

Security is like being chased in the woods by a bear; you don't necessarily have to outrun the bear- if you can outrun your friends. Hackers typically pick the easiest targets.

** Harddrive Encryption

Survey: How many people have gotten a new computer to replace an old one?
Response: Everyone

Comment: There are hardware shredders that can eat hard drives. There are also software means of overwriting data.
Comment: Some laptop harddrives are made with glass platters. Use eyewear if you are breaking them.

** Using the web
* sessions are stored in cookies
* attackers that can access your cookies can impersonate and take control of your identity

** Firesheep
* Monitors what is going on, on the network around it
* Can be used to hijack other users' sessions

** Blacksheep / Firesheperd
* Blacksheep actively monitors and tries to detect if someone is using firesheep.
* Firesheperd actively floods the network around it with fake activity, to make it tougher for humans to analyze connections.
  - Signal to Noise
  - Not a great idea, implicity a DDoS attack

** Old Attacks, new Toys
* ettercap
* wireshark

The problem isn't how do we stop the tools, instead, how do we fix the problem?

** Everyone can play.

** Better Protection
* SSL - one of the few ways; start encrypting data as it moves.
  - Use SSL if you're providing credentials
  - (Firefox Only Plugin) HTTPS Everywhere Preferences
  - (Firefox Only Plugin) ForceTLS Settings

** Old Standbys
* Antivirus
* Software Updates
* Be careful with USB drives

** Smartphones
* A new big problem.
* 55,000 smartphones to 3,000 laptops

** Mobile Data Protection
* Passcode?
* Password to email?
* Sensitive Data?

Phones are almost as capable as laptops at accessing your data. They should be treated as such in regards to safeguarding data.

All vulnerabilities that exist on laptops also exist on mobile phones.

Q: Does anonymous browsing help?
A: No, only for your session. This removes your trail. But, you can use things like Tor and other private networks to keep private.
