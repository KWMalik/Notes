A crumple zone for Service-Oriented Architectures

Outline
* Introduction & Background
* Design of the Crumple Zone
Performance Considerations


The Crumple Zone Concept

* A layer of server-side proxies that 
 - protects a service by absorbing and containing damage
 - goes beyond packet inspection to partially process untrusted data in a sandbox
 - automatically recovers from damage and adapts to attacks

the need for a crumple zone

* policy-based firewalls are great: if you have the right policies
  - zero-day exploits are a fact of life
  - as systems become more inter-connected, policy management becomes more complex
* we recognize that attackers have the initiative: the logical response is to expect some attacks to succeed
  - try to constrain the scope of the attack

the context of crumple zone research

* we have a number of current and recent gov funded research projects inIT security
  - focused on tolerating, surviving attacks
  - strategic concepts include containment and adaptive behavior
* the advanced protected services (APS) project is sponsored by the U.S. Airforce Research Labratory
  - objective: develop concepts and design techniques for survivable SOAs for DoD systems
  - for APS, developed prototype crumple zone for EJB over RMI
  - End product is a prototype that will undergo "red team" ie. Penetration-Testing in a lab.

Crumple Zone vis-a-vis web application firewalls

Concept of Operations:
WAF: Boundary protection in DMZ
Crumple Zone: Second and deeper line of defense for individual services

How it works
WAF: Inspection
Crumple Zone: Inspection and Partial Processing in a sandbox

Deployment Platform
WAF: Dedicated or commodity hardware, distributed if needed
Crumple Zone: Commodity Hardware; enterprise/airborne networks; can be distributed

Protocols
WAF: Mainly HTTP/HTTPs
Crumple Zone: Various our prototype is for EJB over RMI

Maturity
WAF: Commercially Available
Crumple Zone: Early Prototype

*** Perserving Data Integrity

* challenge: traffic must be protected to provide assurance guarantees (confidentiality, integrity, authentication) but must also be subject to full inspection
* Service Layer Virtual Private Groups (sIVPGs) unlock protected traffic for inspection while preserving the protection's guarantees
  - split protected stream into two copies
  - capture and share encryption keys
  - unlock and inspect only one copy; keep the other in escrow

** sIVPG benefits
* remains transparent to the client
  - enables inspection of data from clients we don't control
* can support any connection-oriented protocol
  - used in RMI proto
  - have designed with real use in RMI frameworks
  
Splits:

Client -> Firewall -> Splitter -> A. Mechanism Proxy with Neighborhoods -> Termination Proxy -> Service
Client -> Firewall -> Splitter -> B. Straight to Termination Proxy -> Service

At the escrow point in the Termination Proxy; traffic resumes after processing of data.

** Termination Proxy
* it's main role is to hold data in escrow until it passes security checks (performed elsewhere)
* exposes a service endpoint to which clients connect
* terminates the client's SSL connection and is responsible for key negotiation and sharing
* a watchdog automatically restarts proxy if there is a failure

** Firewall Component
* the firewall is used to actively control data flow as well as to filter packets
  - protects the termination proxy
  - splitter relies on firewall rules to split data
* we use IP tables firewall

** firewall: single packet authorization
* the crumple zone itself is an obvious target for an attacker
* SPA firewall starts with a deny-all policy to minimize attack surface
  1. client sends a special crypto packet requesting a port be opened
  2. daemon adds a firewall rule allowing limited-time connection from client's IP address
  3. Client connects through firewall to termination proxy
* we use an open-source implementation called KnockKnock
  - http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/knockknock
* protects against port-scanning

** firewall: splitting SSL traffic
1. a client connects to the termination proxy; the splitter is listening to (but not decrypting) the client's stream
2. termination proxy signals the splitter to allow forwarding
3. the splitter loads iptables rules per connection to direct traffic to a designated netfilter queue (NFQ)
4. the NFQ captures and copies the stream as original packets (no decryption yet)

** mechanism proxy collection
* the split ssl data stream goes to a distributed collection of mechanism proxies
  - MPs send authorization signal to termination proxy
  - Termination proxy releases data from escrow only if it is authorized within a timeout period

** security checks: mechanism proxies
  - each mechanism proxy is designed to be small and simple
  - proxies are expected to occasionally die
  - we have implemented the following in our prototype:
~ via inspection
  RMI object size check
  RMI invocation rate check
  Java class whitelist
~ via emulation
  Java deserialization "canary" proxy
  
** an emulation-based proxy: the "canary"
* There are JEE vulnerabilities based on (lack of) type safety in Java deserialization (REF: Schoenefeld 2006)
* "Canary in a coal mine" deserializes RMI objects into a safe(r) JVM to protect against attacks for which we have no /a priori/ signature
  - JVM may have extended monitoring, restricted class composition, restricted class instantiation

Q: What is the cost of adding all these layers? Do you have performance data?
A: This is somewhat a burden on machine-level time; not so much on user time.

Q: Does some level of hardware use improve latency?
A: We think so. If we tried, we could.

** Proxy Groups
* Mechanism proxies collaborate in groups
* Proxies can execute sequentially or in parallel
* Each SSL connection is checked by its own associated proxy group
