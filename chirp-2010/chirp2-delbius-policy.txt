--- API Policy Team led by @delbius (Del Harvey)

-- ground rules for developers

don't surprise users in a bad way
don't create or distribute spam
respect user privacy
adhere to our trademark and display guidelines
reach out to us with questions and suggestions
adhere to our terms of service and twitter rules
be awesome
* twitter team will look at apps and test-drive

-- what led to those ground rules, anyways

horrible things, what, you wanted details? fine.
misleading descriptions of app functions resulted in unsettled and upset users
spam sucks and creates a bad user experience
 * autofollow not really allowed
 * autofollow-back should be used sparingly
 * no auto-unfollow
privacy is important and users care a lot about it (and they should!)
 * robme.com example. users implicitly trust app makers
 * rules against mangling or auto-editing tweets - see ustream hashtag issues
guidelines help us ensure things are rendered accurately
awesomeness is awesome

-- so, what do you want to talk about?

are developers allowed to store permanent copies of tweets? (My Question!! via Google Moderator)
* if it is necessary to cache a timeline- but don't permanently store a tweet, unless the user is fully aware their tweets are being stored
* can a developer download a long stream of data? generally not 
* plans to liberate all tweets and at some point there will no longer be a cap at 3200
* make sure you're not crawling and just storing corpus of data

what is twitter doing to ensure it does not abuse the power it has over api devs and users at twitter?
* twitter tries to do it's best not to get in the way
* ex: OAuth tokens don't get checked right away. developers are allowed to use the tokens right away upon request.

can my tweets say they're from me & my blog, instead of my app?
* yes, if you apply for a source parameter
* do not offer services that require a consumer secret/token from a user

if somebody is not showing in search, what's happening w/that?
* search algorithmically filters out spammy updates. if your app is sending out lots of dupe messages, it may get filtered out from search.
