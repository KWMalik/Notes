Case Study: Domino's Pizza
Domino's Pizza is experimenting with Azure to handle peak-overload.
Their entire web application is written in Java.
[Speaker] We support everything. PHP, Ruby, Java, etc.

Other examples of services that can benefit:
  Restaurant Ordering Services
  Tax Services
  Persistent Access Services
  Peak Access Services

Not suitable for (Due to cost):
  Personal Blogs
  Club Sites
  Community Group
  Random Low-Bandwidth Access

General Starting Cost: $90/month
Hurdle is higher due to SLA, Bandwidth, Server Allocation, Uptime, etc.

Q: Is there a sandbox or test mode for Azure?
A: Only in Dev Mode, Local testing.

Q: Do development tools support non .NET apps on local workstation development?
A: Yes. More information shortly.

Q: Is there a test or dev container for local server environments?
A: No. Can only test localmachine or in-cloud.

Q: Are there caps available?
A: No, not yet.

AppFabric is the hosting environment for applications, akin in architecture to Tomcat or Websphere for Java Apps.

AppFabric for Windows Server released recently, spawned from codename projects Velocity and Dublin. Assists in hosting WCF services.

See Don Box episode (??) on DotNetRocks for more information about windows app-fabric frameworks in general.

Cloud Fabric
* Like an IIS server
* Multiple Virtual Instances
* Easily provision applications
* Detect Failures
* Spin up new instances to replace failed ones
* How many instances and decide what role they play
* Load balancing and DNS available
* Elasticity of the service, scale up/down the number of instances

Dev Fabric (Local Developer Simulation of Cloud Fabric)
* Like Cassini (the .NET web server used for debugging)
* Simulated "Cloud Experience" for Development
* Routes cloud requests to local machine
* Simulates data storage with local SQL server database
* Azure SQL simulated with local SQL Server database

There is no local development version of SQL Azure. Use SQL Express instead.

Q: How does licensing work? Is there a requirement to license windows server instances?
A: No. Completely consumption based.

Q: Is data in SQL Azure securable?
A: Data is locked down by firewall, with user account restrictions, etc.

Getting Started

The Windows Azure SDK
http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/developers/
Works on 2008, 2010RC, and 2010 final coming in April.
2010 Beta 2 does not work with this SDK.

SDK Features

???

Windows Azure Roles

Web Role
* A web role is used for web application programming in ASP.NET or PHP

Worker Role
* A worker role is used for performing work on behalf of the web role
* In addition to .NET languages, worker roles may be written in Ruby or Java, etc.
* Worker Roles are used to improve scalability by increasing parallelism and asynchronicity
* Often used for background work

Binary-Formatted communication is available between Web <-> Worker Role.

ASP.NET Web Role
WCF Service Web Role
CGI Web Role - PHP / FastCGI application
Worker Role

Code Instrumentation and Tracing is more important for cloud apps. Cannot attach a debugger to a cloud instance. Only logging/instrumentation data is available to monitor cloud activity.

Q: Does Azure also have its own instrumentation API?
A: Yes, in addition to .NET, WCF, etc.

Local Dev Fabric is durable- will retain new storage between debugging sessions.

Development Fabric UI can be used to examine instances and data. Has console output to allow observation of Trace information.

Developer Experience
* Leverage Existing Skills in .NET, SQL Server, WCF
* User Familiar Tools - Visual Studio, SSMS
* RESTful HTTP cloud services, supports PHP, Python
* Cloud apps can be developed locally / offline
* SDK Clouod Simulator - Dev Fabric, Dev Storage

Application Concerns - Hardware
* Server Instances
** Plan for peak usage scenarios
** Plan for redundancy to reduce down time
** Make up-front capital expenditures
*** servers
*** software
*** other

SQL Azure Features
* Supported
  - Tables, Indexes, Views
  - Stored Procedures
  - Triggers
  - Constraints
  - Table Variables
  - Temp Tables (#Name)
  - Profiling (??)
* Not Supported
  - Physical Server Access
  - Catalog DDL
  - Common Language Runtime
  - Service Broker
  - Reporting Services
  - Analysis Services
  - Distributed Transactions and Queries

Q: Does SQL Azure support profiling/traces?
A: Local versions, yes. Will also support (due to design) azure as a result of observing queries over connection.

SQL Azure Databases are partitioned automatically, and the TX log is also on a separate volume.

Q: If I have a large dataset that has been split across physical databases, can I access this dataset without using a distributed transaction?
A: Yes. The distributed transaction semantic limitations are removed.
Example: Order in NYC, Inventory in Chicago. An insert  at NYC would require an update at Chicago. But because the database is not bound to a location, this sort of query no longer requires knowledge of separate locations and databases.

Q: Are nested transactions supported?
A: ???

Q: How does SQL Azure handle failover and standby operations?
A: TBD.

Initial Services
  - Database - Core SQL Server database capabilities

Future Services
  - Data Sync - Enables the Sync Framework
  - Additional SQL Server capabilities available as a service:
    Business Intelligence
    Reporting
  - New Services
    Reference Data
    Secure Data Hub

In terms of size, most databases to date do not exceed 10gb, per citation of Microsoft Market Research.

SQL Azure TDS - Tabular Data Stream is the data model for SQL Azure.
There are always at least 3 instances of data somewhere in the cloud.
No management of tempDB concerns.

Working assumption is that replication is perfect mirroring granular to the instruction.
No living backups for SQL Azure. Auto-provisioning handles backups/mirroring.

Access rules may be setup by IP/Filter.

sqlazuremw.codeplex.com - SQL Azure Migration Wizard
requires SQL Server 2008 R2

SQL Azure login requires fully-qualified name. USER@AZURENAME.

Affinity Regions are available to allow grouping of servers and datas in the same datacenter region.

Endpoints are REST URLs for various services.

Blob Storage
- unstructured storage
- partitioned by container
- unlimited containers

Cloud streams don't behave much differently from .NET streams.

Azure Data Storage - Tables
- Windows Azure Table provides scalable, available, and durable structured storage in the form of tables.
- the tables contain entities, and the entities contain properties.
- the tables are scalable to billions of entities and terabytes of data, and the data may be partitioned acrosss thousands of servers.
- the tables support ACID transactions over single entities and rich queries over the entire table.
- simple and familiar .NET and REST programming interfaces ae provided via ADO.NET data services

Table Storage Terms
- ???

Table Comparison
SQL Azure Tables
- Fully structured
- strongly typed
- relational (RDMS)
- highly scalable
windows azure tables
- semi-structured
- loosely typed
- nonrelational
