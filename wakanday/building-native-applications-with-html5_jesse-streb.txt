2011 - the rise of hybrids

hybrids living among us

netflix
linkedin
	note that app and m.linkedin.com are very similar
facebook

mobile browser challenges

data connections are slow (if even existent)
cpu power low (well, relatively low compared to desktops)
	you have to take advantage of what the phone offers, not impose what the phone should do
small amount of memory
fixed headers, scrolling and transitions
	lot of solutions where people are trying to implement their own scrolling (css translates)
	challenging
different resolutions / DPI
	be mindful of iPhone 3G/4 differences
responsive design required - orientation changes
	bostonglobe has become the gold standard for responsive design changes
	use liquid layouts

frameworks and libraries that help
	jquery mobile
	sencha touch
	jo
	kendo UI
	zepto.js
	xui.js
	jQTouch
	(micro frameworks, spot solutions, piece together only what you need)

jQuery Mobile
quick to get up and running
progressive enhancement, from feature phones to current phones
doesn't have a native feel; may not be the best choice for embedding into a native app

sencha touch
fantastic job of making ui components look like native versions
higher learning curve
all javascript based
built on top of ext.js (some love it, some hate)

micro frameworks
http://microframeworks.js

zepto.js
	jquery for webkit (?)
mustache / markup.js
backbone.js
	used by linkedin
iScroll / scrollability
	momentum scrolling

native containers
what you're looking for is a means to talk to the api for the device and not just the browser offerings

phonegap
	huge variety of phones
	open source
	apache license
	natobi - acquired by adobe

appcelerator / titanium
	javascript apis that compile down to native code

appcloud
	similar approach, like phonegap
	data navigation
		breakup sections into their own pages, for maintenance and code reuse

appcloud + jquery mobile
