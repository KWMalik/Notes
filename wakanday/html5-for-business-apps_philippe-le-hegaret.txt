REF: http://www.w3.org/2011/Talks/1015-wakanday/

HTML5 and the Open Web Platform

    * Web pages are more beautiful, interactive, intelligent
    * HTML5 provides cross-browser interoperability and all major browser vendors plan to support it
    * Video a first-class citizen
    * Simplified data integration
    * Numerous devices
    * Tools for social networking (privacy, security, identity)
    * The most interoperable platform in the industry 

"a month ago i was at a meeting in hollywood, discussing html5 on the tv; and not too long thereafter, set-top boxes with webkit; etc. you're seeing web technologies starting to be used in all sorts of contexts, not what you expect. even itunes internally is now html5."

HTML5 and the Open Web Platform

    * Powerful, modular: documents, multimedia, interactivity
    * Multi-application: electronic books, user interfaces, games
    * Common across devices: desktop, mobile, tablet, television 

Benefits

    * Better Web application adaptation to multiple devices, e.g. Boston Globe
    * Reduce the size of Web applications
    * Reduce the need to install third-party plug-ins
    * Facilitate deployment of applications across platforms: one dev platform for all
    * Allow more complex applications to be pushed and deployed through the Web Cloud 

"there is only web. not mobile-web, desktop-web, etc. only one web."

HTML5 and the Open Web Platform

    * More than a 100 royalty-free technologies within the same environment: HTML5, CSS3, SVG1, Web Sockets, Web Workers, Indexed Database, File, Geolocation, etc.
    * Incremental evolution of the platform: Real-Time Web Communications, Audio, User Timing

Timeline

Each component follows its own timeline:

    * HTML5 expected to be final by 2014
    * Gathering use cases for HTML.next
    * First release of HTML5 Test Suite in early 2012
    * Several modules for CSS3 are final, as well as Geolocation, Navigation Timing 

Adoption

    * "2.1 Billion HTML5 Browsers on Mobile Devices by 2016 says ABI Research" - July 22, 2011

"forget about skype in a few years. we're already working on codecs for two way communication. you'll be able to do this entirely in the browser."

Web Performance APIs

Goal: provide methods to enhance aspects of application performance of user agent features and APIs.

    * Navigation and Resource Timing: access timing information related to navigation and elements
    * User Timing: high precision timestamps
    * Page Visibility: determine the current visibility state of the page
    * Timing control for script-based animations: script-based animations where the user agent is in control

Navigation Timing

Navigation Timing:
		Redirect:	?ms
		App cache:	?ms
		DNS lookup:	?ms
		TCP Connection:	?ms
		TCP Request:	?ms
		Processing:	?ms
		Total page load:	?ms

[No support for timing information in your Web browser]

  sd=function() {
    var a=window.performance
          ||window.webkitPerformance;
    return (a=a&&a.timing)
            &&a.loadEventStart-a.fetchStart
  }

Security Considerations
Be aware of security and privacy considerations before using those features!

As a Web developer:

    * Offline storage: Web Storage & IndexedDB:
          o Privacy: Sensitivity of Data
          o Security: Cross-directory attacks
    * HTML5 forms: Servers should not rely on client-side validation.

Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.0

<li role="menuitemcheckbox"
       onclick='doAction();'
       aria-checked="true">Sort by Last Modified</li>

The contract model with accessibility APIs

What's missing?

    * Video Streaming (adaptive and live), P2P
    * TV remote, DLNA
    * TV channels, Speech
    * More Web performance benchmarks
    * 3D at the markup level (SVG equivalent)
    * Identity, Access control
    * Security, Privacy
    * Digital content distribution and micropayment
    * Data and query server discovery, service description
    * Federated query server
    * Trust, Provenance
    * Read-write Web
    * Interoperability
    * Education materials
    * Certification (software and developers)
    * Authoring tools support
    * Multilingual support
    * Publishing pipeline: more on XML?
    * …
